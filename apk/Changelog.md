* Fix issue prevent visualizing VODs on user VOD list from lives that have yet ended
* General user history improves
* Improved error detection, when a page fail to load or when a video fail to load a more proper error message will explain what happens (this can be used to understand if there is a issue or was just a something expected as a error cause by internet lag)
* Improve player controls descriptions and functionality

##New features:

* Preview video everywhere (setting options to disable it new preview)
