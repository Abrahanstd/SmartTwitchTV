I took sometime from making small updates to make a bigger update.
On this version I addressed all minor problems that I have on the app TODO list plus added all features that was on the app user request list.

## Improves changes:

* Improve Notification service, it now fully works on phones and tablets and is more reliable
* Phones and tablet only, Fix virtual D-pad not showing when a preview video was playing
* General performance improve 
* General visual improves
* Genera Strings (app text) improves (English is my second language I keep improve as I learn it)
* Fix issue prevent visualizing VODs on user VOD list from lives that have yet ended
* General user history improves
* Improved error detection, when a page fail or a video fail to load, a proper error message will explain what happen (this can be used to understand if there is a issue or was just something expected as a error cause by internet lag)
* Improve player controls descriptions and functionality

## New features:

* Preview video everywhere (setting options to disable it new preview)
* The preview is the main player, meaning that after the preview has loaded you can press enter to open the player without any buffer, the same for exiting, after a video is playing exiting will go back to the screen that open the video without closing the player
* Multi settings option to control all types of previews, controls for sizes, volume and etc related
