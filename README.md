This is an application for Samsung SmartTV's designed to watch Twitch.tv broadcasts, A official Twitch.TV app is not available for most countries, that is way this project exist.

The application is tested and fully support 4k and 1080p Samsung TV released on 2016 and up, if TV is from 2015 and it's SmartHub menu is different from the one bellow image yours TV may not fully supported Twitch Live or Vod streams playback.

Full support for all 2015 TV is not possible as the TV firmware doesn't supports it and Samsung doesn't seems to care and may have remove the featuring intentionally, a discussion about it can be read in this issue [**2015 TV model running Tizen 2.3, can't play bug [Testers needed]**](https://github.com/fgl27/smarttv-twitch/issues/12)

In doubt [open a issue](https://github.com/fgl27/smarttv-twitch/issues/new/choose) inform yours TV model, computer OS and problem, if is a installation problem share the fail LOG

About this fork
===============

I fork this from https://github.com/CazuzaCzz/smarttv-twitch/commits/tizen
The original fork is https://github.com/nikitakatchik/smarttv-twitch

I have started this project because the above repo of the app did not fully support my TV model, it had many bugs and the app did not had the main Twitch.TV featuring like a more complete users interface (For VOD, Cips, basic Channel off line content, Chat and etc) it also didn't fully support the latest version of Samsung smart remote, etc etc...

So I work a long time writing this a new application basically from scratch focusing on performance and all available Twitch.TV featuring, with the help of some users reporting bugs and making featuring request, I add the many featuring and work all the bugs, today the application is very complete, can be easily used to watch all available Twitch.TV content and give the user a lot of extra options, but is know that the application can be always improved, new featuring and improves are always in the works, mostly to give a better experience and more options to the user, but as today there is only one main developer working on this project the process is slow, but fell free to report bugs and make request, for that use the [open a issue option of this repo](https://github.com/fgl27/smarttv-twitch/issues/new/choose).
